I could not be bothered to write a readme so I asked Co-pilot to do it for me. 

"Wildnodes is a sovereign, off-grid network architecture designed for expressive, theatrical, and resilient digital living. It blends modular hardware, mythic interfaces, and ritual-driven protocols to create a decentralized infrastructure for community, creativity, and control."

As you can see, it was a mistake :)
